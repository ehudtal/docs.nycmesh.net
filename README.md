# NYC Mesh Wiki 

This is the public NYC Mesh Wiki. It should be the main source for our documentation and help everyone join and run the mesh!

To run this Wiki locally for development or in-mesh use, one can install jekyll and begin the server.  
On Ubuntu / Debian, for example:
```
git clone ( this repo )
cd ( this repo )
apt install ruby
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

Visit NYCMesh.net for more information about the network as a whole.
