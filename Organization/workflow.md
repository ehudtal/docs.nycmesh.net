**Join form**

Everything begins with the [Join form](https://nycmesh.net/join)
This creates a new row in the main spreadsheet and assigns a node number and sends a support ticket

**Main spreadsheet**

Once in the spreadsheet a new node becomes a gray dot on [our map](nycmesh.net/map)

**Support Ticketing**

We use OSTicket for support tickets

**Install viability, panoramas etc**

A main bottleneck is figuring out which installs are viable. Usually this means line-of-sight to one of our supernodes, or a nearby kiosk.

**Scheduling an install**

Once an install is deemed viable we send a link to our calendar so the new member can book an install. 

**Acuity calendar**
